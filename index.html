    <H1>Healthy Eating Habits</h1>

    Healthy eating is essential for maintaining good health, feeling better, and having more energy. It's not just about strict dietary limitations or depriving yourself of the foods you love.

    Why Eat Healthy?
    Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it's about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.

   Key Components of a Healthy Diet
   
        Fruits and Vegetables: Packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
        Whole Grains: Include foods like whole wheat, brown rice, oats, and quinoa.
        Protein Sources: Choose lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and nuts.
        Dairy: Opt for low-fat or fat-free dairy products.
